# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Agent Lab are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Prevented `list_dir` from following Windows junctions and other reparse points outside the workspace, and corrected exact-limit truncation metadata.
- Blocked common credential files and directories such as `.npmrc`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.aws`, `.kube`, and cloud credential JSON files from read-only tools.
- Made registered Tool definitions immutable and required Provider-exported parameter schemas to have a JSON-serializable object root.
- Enforced that an AgentRun's optional user Message belongs to the same Conversation through an additive Alembic migration.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- FastAPI and React/Vite project foundations with service-specific environment examples.
- SQLite/SQLAlchemy/Alembic persistence for conversations, messages, and successful LLM calls.
- Vendor-neutral LLM contracts, an OpenAI-compatible adapter, and a strict Model Registry.
- Non-streaming and SSE Chat with model selection, recent conversations, and refresh recovery.
- Successful-call token, estimated cost, and Provider latency persistence.
- Safe request IDs, classified HTTP/SSE errors, redacted request/model-call logs, and mocked regression coverage.
- Responsive Chat workspace states and sanitized desktop/mobile release screenshots.

### Security And Reliability

- Provider, database, validation, and unexpected failures return fixed readable responses without exposing credentials, SQL, upstream bodies, or complete messages.
- Failed and cancelled turns roll back instead of leaving partial persisted conversation state.
- Terminal SSE errors release the frontend response reader, and stale conversation-list refreshes cannot overwrite newer state.
- Release verification uses mocks and a fresh temporary database; it does not call a real Provider or modify the user's local database.

### Known Limitations

- Live DeepSeek/OpenRouter connectivity is configuration-supported but not exercised by release verification.
- Token, estimated cost, and latency are persisted on `LLMCall` but are not displayed in the frontend.
- Provider retries/fallback, persistent failed-call audit rows, and Plan 4 Trace are not implemented.
- SSE failures after response start use a terminal `event: error` frame on an HTTP 200 stream.
- `models.json` is not yet declared as wheel/sdist package data; the supported current workflow is an editable source install.
- Older ignored local SQLite databases can predate the current foreign-key indexes and are not automatically rebuilt.
- Conversation pagination/search/rename/delete and Markdown rendering are deferred.
